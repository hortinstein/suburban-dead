# suburban-dead
This is a clone of [Urban Dead](http://www.urbandead.com/) by [Kevan Davis](http://kevan.org/).  

I plan on using this project to refine my knowledge of some technology aspects, while learning others.  Here is the current planned stack and messy roadmap, this will be refined as I continue development:

Initial Prototype (likely available via some prototype boilerplate):
  -MongoDB for data persistence
  -React front end
  -Node.js bandend
  -Webpack
  -Deployment to Modulus
  -Auth using google/github/twitter etc

This was always a project I wanted to play with doing back when I was in school as I played Urban Dead in the Comptuer Lab with a classmate in 2005...so Brian, yes it is time to build "Zombie game"
